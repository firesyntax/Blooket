This is a addition of all the import codes that work,
Use the inspect tool file if the CTRL+SHIFT+I doesnt work,
Use the inspect tool if when you right click and your school blocked inspect element,
TO USE THE INSPECT TOOL, FIRST BOOKMARK IT THEN CLICK MORE THEN DELETE THE CURRENT URL AND THEN CTRL+V THE CODE FROM INSPECT TOOL YOU COPIED AND CLICK DONE AND IT WORKS ON SOME WEBSITES, YOU CAN NAME IT WHATEVER, IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE TOOL BY ANY WAY
